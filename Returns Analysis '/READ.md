# 🔁 Project 5: Superstore Returns Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary

This Business Intelligence project focused on identifying patterns and underlying causes of product returns at Superstore. By joining returns and order data, I created a dynamic Tableau dashboard and Story to surface trends by category, geography, customer behavior, and time. These insights offer actionable strategies to reduce return rates, optimize operations, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

* **Data Visualization (Tableau Public)** – Interactive dashboards with maps, scatterplots, bar charts, and time series
* **Data Joining** – Merged Returns and Orders datasets using unique order IDs
* **Calculated Fields** – Created KPIs like Return Rate %, Return Volume, and Developer Responsiveness
* **UX-Focused Dashboard Design** – Built a multi-slide Tableau Story for executive decision-making
* **Data Storytelling** – Used annotated visuals to guide analysis and strategic recommendations

## 📈 Key Business Insights

* **Category Red Flags**: Subcategories like Tables had high return rates relative to low sales
* **Customer Trends**: Repeat returners and specific regions (e.g., California, Utah) accounted for the majority of returns
* **Seasonality Effects**: Returns peaked between August and December, pointing to holiday-driven stress or dissatisfaction
* **Geographic Hotspots**: Certain states consistently showed higher-than-average return percentages
* **Technology Category**: Led all product groups in return rate, signaling a need to revisit customer support or expectations

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

* Return Rate vs. Sales Volume by Product
* Return Trends by Geography and Time
* Return Rate by Customer (Excluding One-Time Buyers)
* Composite Views (Category × Region, Category × Time)
* Interactive Filters for deep-dive exploration
