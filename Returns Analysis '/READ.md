# 🔁 Project 5: Superstore Returns Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary  
This Business Intelligence project aimed to uncover root causes behind Superstore’s elevated product return rates. By combining return and order data, I developed a multi-layered Tableau dashboard to analyze return trends across product categories, regions, customer types, and time. These insights provide executives with actionable recommendations to improve retention, reduce losses, and optimize inventory and logistics strategies.
