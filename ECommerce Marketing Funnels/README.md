# 🛒 Project 3: E-Commerce Marketing Funnels

## 📌 Project Summary

This Business Intelligence project explores user behavior and retention on an e-commerce platform through cohort-based analysis and funnel visualization. The goal was to understand customer purchase patterns, identify drop-off stages in the funnel, and recommend improvements to optimize conversion rates and long-term retention.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

* **Google Sheets** – Data transformation, cohort modeling, pivot tables
* **Data Cleaning** – Standardized columns, filled missing values, documented transformations
* **Conversion Funnel Analysis** – Mapped users from page views to purchases
* **Cohort Analysis** – Tracked retention over time by first purchase date
* **Documentation** – Change log and methodology steps for transparency
* **Business Recommendations** – Actionable strategies to improve user engagement

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🔄 Conversion Funnel
