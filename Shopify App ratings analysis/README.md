# 🛒 Project 6: Shopify App Store Analytics

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explored public data from the Shopify App Store to understand what drives app success. Using Power BI, we built interactive dashboards to evaluate review patterns, developer responsiveness, and performance across app categories.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

* **Power BI**: Created dashboards with KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.
* **DAX Functions**: Built calculated columns like `helpful_reviews` and `developer_answered` to assess review impact and responsiveness.
* **Data Modeling**: Connected relational tables (`apps`, `reviews`, `categories`) via many-to-one joins for accurate cross-analysis.
* **Data Visualization**: Highlighted trends in app ratings, review volume, and developer behavior using dynamic visuals.

## 📈 Key Insights

* **App Volume**: Identified 7,341 unique apps on the Shopify marketplace.
* **Review Trends**: Apps with 350+ reviews showed higher average ratings, leveling off after 24,000 reviews.
* **Responsiveness Matters**: Apps with developer replies had higher average and helpful ratings, suggesting better customer satisfaction.
* **Top Performers**: Specific developers stood out in responsiveness and review quality, indicating reliable app support.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The analysis included the following pages:

1. **App Landscape** – Overview of app volume, review trends, and rating distributions
2. **Reviews** – Weighted helpfulness scores and responsiveness impact
3. **App Reviews** – Developer comparisons by review quality and engagement

> Screenshots of each visualization are included in the project folder.
