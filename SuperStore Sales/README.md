# 🛍️ Project 4: Superstore Sales Optimization

## 📌 Project Summary

In this Business Intelligence project, I analyzed Superstore’s operational and sales data to uncover profitable product lines, assess advertising ROI, and identify high-risk items with return issues. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to guide strategic decisions in merchandising, marketing, and return policy management.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

* **Tableau Public** – Interactive dashboards with filters, calculated fields, and multi-dimensional views
* **Data Cleaning** – Prepared and filtered product, return, and order data
* **Data Visualization** – Bar charts, maps, time series, and heatmaps
* **Business Acumen** – Delivered actionable insights for improving profit margins and return outcomes
* **Ad Spend Analysis** – Identified high-ROAS state/month combinations to optimize marketing budget

## 📈 Key Business Insights

* **Product Strategy**: Copiers and Phones were top profit generators; Bookcases and Tables showed significant losses
* **Advertising ROI**: Best performance found in Indiana (Oct), and Vermont (Nov & Apr), justifying localized ad spend
* **Return Management**: Binders had the highest return rate and lowest profit; Copiers had strong performance with minimal returns
* **Customer Behavior**: Return rates spiked in certain categories and states, informing policy and stocking strategies

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

* Profit/Loss Heatmap by Subcategory and Region
* Average Return Rate vs. Profitability by Product
* Advertising ROAS by State & Month
* Geographic return clustering via map visualization
* Composite views combining category, time, and geography
